# Welcome Raff_Py 
## Journey Raspberry Pi Pico and MircoPython 

Hello, I'm EchoSniper, an EEE student trying to enhance my microcontroller skills. 
I'm trying to document my progress in a repository, ensuring that I have access to my codes whenever I encounter challenges. 
Also, I aim to make these resources open to all.
By sharing them, individuals with a basic understanding of Python can utilize the code to enhance their skills in Mircopython Skills.
Let's learn and grow together!
