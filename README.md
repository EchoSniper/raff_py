Hello, I'm EchoSniper, an EEE student dedicated to enhancing my microcontroller skills. 
I'm committed to documenting my progress in a repository, ensuring that I have access to my codes whenever I encounter challenges. 
Moreover, I aim to make these resources open to all. By sharing them, individuals with a basic understanding of Python can utilize the code to enhance their skills in microcontroller programming. 
Let's learn and grow together!
